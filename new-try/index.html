                <p class="grid-story">
                    I graduated with 87/100 in the Maintenance Technician studying path
                         from <a href="https://www.ipsiameucci.edu.it/" 
                         target="_blank">I.P.S.I.A. A. Meucci</a>
                          Professional High-School in Cagliari,
                       Sardinia. I also took an electrician regional qualification with
                      94/100. I loved study electrical subjects, but most important,
                       I was fascinated by the programming language SIEMENS Step 5 and
                        Step 7. I loved the logic behind and the satisfaction of 
                       creating and fixing codes, especially the tough ones.

                    After my school graduation and some job experience in an optical fiber
                    company and plastic bags factory, I decided to dedicate better my time to improving my 
                   coding, so I looked for some web coding course than I found an <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a> begginers
                   course offered by MichiganX &#40;an online learning initiative of the University of
                   Michigan&#41; for Python devided in 2 main parts; the first for getting started
                   and the second for Python Data Structures, pretty cheap for starting my coding career.

                    Under the advice of one of my close friends, I decided to start a Master's in Back End Development
                    at <a href="https://www.start2impact.it/">Start2Impact University</a> because I was missing
                    programming and tired of doing nothing or unsatisfactory jobs. So I started with a course in HTML & CSS and
                    this is my first project &#40;I also made a <a href="assets/yt-clone/youtube.html" target="_blank">YouTube clone</a> following a
                     video tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=2662s">SuperSimpleDev</a>&#41;.
                     Now I'm again getting the beautiful feeling of coding,
                     the sensational aspect of logic, and the full-emotional feeling of doing a complex code that works how I want to.
